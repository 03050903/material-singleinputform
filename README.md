Android-SingleInputForm
=======================

A single EditText instead of a classical form.

This Library is a library implementation of  [flavienlaurent's "Single input form"][1]

_Very inspired by the [Minimal Format Interface][2]._

Implement any form with only one EditText. The idea here is to pack a multiple input form in one field. As a result, the user input is easier and a more fluent process.

Also, [TextSwitcher][3] got completely rediscovered to animate the form: title, error message. It's very basic but simple to use.

Here is a video demonstrating a sample form:

PS: I will soon release this project to maven repository.
